      <ul>
        <li>languages: python, sql, javascript, bit of ruby (thanks to <a href="https://github.com/sharonwoo/sharonwoo.github.io">blog</a>); 
                       english (native), mandarin (native), japanese (jlpt n3)</li>
          <li>aws: redshift, s3, cloudfront, lambda, dynamodb</li>
            <ul>
              <li>s3, cloudfront, lambda: this project; domain from namecheap + ssl cert generated with acm</li>
              <li>lambda: built a telegram bot to spam myself with hourly details of my last played track. bot is now offline because i now subscribe to youtube/music instead</li>
              <li>redshift: my job - created some tables and wrote tests</li>
            </ul>
          <li>gcp: cloud bucket, bigquery</li>
            <ul>
              <li><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FBkTt9GJbxM">job scraper</a> - scraping on a raspberry pi with selenium, job descriptions dumped to cloud bucket; 
                working on loading to bigquery and visualisation. previous use case required local storage and visualisation in tableau.</li>
              <li>bigquery etl (<a href="https://github.com/sharonwoo/bigquery-takehome">repo</a>): toy etl for data warehouse with staging and production projects, 
                  with single business logic layer. used github actions to manage CICD for tables - pull request would check if business logic and tables generated correctly in staging, 
                  and merge to main (which is only possible with codeowner review) would automatically generate tables in production.
              </li>
            </ul>
          <li>django/django-rest-framework + docker (<a href="https://github.com/sharonwoo/grant-household-api-docker">repo</a>): backend web api with authentication</li>
          <li>flask: tool to diff transcripts to evaluate effectiveness of machine transcription against a verified human-transcribed sourcce, now down due to heroku change of policy</li>
      </ul>

      <ul>
        <li>Working with data engineering to architect new data models and pipelines serving reports on Looker, as well as appropriate governance policies and documentation, 
            and a migration strategy from existing data lake which has neither layers nor documentation and which transformations are encoded in a mix of Ruby, SQL, and Scala.
            <ul>
              <li class="extra-margin">Proposed augmentations include an ERD, a 4 layer data warehouse with dimensional modelling, proper CICD pipeline, a sandbox for adhocs, etc.</li>

        <li>Ensured existing legacy reports worked through infrastructure migration (Redshift) less than a month after I joined

        </li>
        <li>Saved significant engineering resources upon discovery that a SaaS mobile marketing analytics and attribution platform integration 
            with a third-party payments platform (ongoing migration) was not needed per end-user analytics requirements which were previously wrongly scoped -
