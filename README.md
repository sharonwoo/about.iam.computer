CICD is work in progress and likely to involve some Terraform. 
HTML / CSS was written from scratch without using any frameworks, because I used to do this as a kid (everyone had a blog before Facebook, thank god they're all gone now).

Next steps:
* Make toys for portfolio and update **show me the code** section 
* Lead tracking (currently stalking CORS API hits with CloudWatch logs)
